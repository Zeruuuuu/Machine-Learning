# Machine-Learning
Machine learning projects that include both supervised and unsupervised learning. Include models like KNN, linear regression, logistic regression, LDA, Naive Bayes, tree based methods (random forest, decision tree, XGboost, Extra trees..), SVM, K-Means, K-medoids clustering.... Include tuning/pipeline methods for those models above. Optimized machine learning models in different approaches.
